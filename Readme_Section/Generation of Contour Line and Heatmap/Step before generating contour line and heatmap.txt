### Step before generating contour line and heatmap

Before generating the maps, please run the script `Contour_Line\AppendingPreductionToCells.py` first.

**Modified Line(please fill the path for your WSI image and extracted cellular features.)**:

Line 20: `path=r'./Contour_Line/ExtractedData/'` **(Fill the path of the extracted cellular features)**

**Modified Line for Code Running**: 

Line 25: `ref_data = pd.read_csv("./trainingdata.csv") #Fill the Training Data path`**(Fill the path of training data used in the model training)**

**Modified Line(please fill the path for saving the results.)**:

Line 48: `name='./PredictedData/'+filename[:-4]+'.csv'` **(Fill the path for saving the network result)**
 
**Script outputs**:

* **EX1_2_.csv**: *.csv* file which contains the network output result based on the provided cellular features.
