### Cross-Validation

To run the machine learning algorithms in Cross-Validation, please follow the steps below: 

**Step 1**: run `machinelearn_internal.py`

**Modified Line(please fill the path for the data. Please note that the Cross-Validation needs to modified the Fold manually)**:

Line 111: `Train_data_path="801010/"` **(Fill the root path of the internal data)**

Line 116, `data = pd.read_csv(Train_data_path+'train_cross10.csv')` **(Fill the file name of the training data)**

Line 133: `data2 = pd.read_csv(Train_data_path+'test_cross10.csv')` **(Fill the file name of the testing data)**

**Modified Line(please fill the path for saving the results.)**:

Line 112: `Result_path=""`

**Script outputs**:

* **(Machine Learning Algorithm).csv**: *.csv* file which contains the predicted results of machine learning models for internal data.

**Step 2**: run `Machine_learning_internal_generation.py`

**Modified Line(please fill the path for the data. Please note that the Cross-Validation needs to modified the Fold manually)**:

Line 4: `csv_data=pd.read_csv(r"Internal/K-SVM.csv")` **(Fill the path of the predicted result in the Step 1)**

Line 17: `csv_data=pd.read_csv(r"801010/final_training_gt.csv")` **(Fill the path of the ground truth)**

**Modified Line(please fill the path for saving the results.)**:

Line 76: `final.to_csv(r"internal_result/K-SVM.csv")`

**Script outputs**:

* **(Machine Learning Algorithm).csv**: *.csv* file which contains the triage list of machine learning models for internal data. 

In this section, it does not contain the scores. If you want to generate the score for calculating AUC or finding priorities, please turn to section **External Dataset, Internal Dataset for Score**.
