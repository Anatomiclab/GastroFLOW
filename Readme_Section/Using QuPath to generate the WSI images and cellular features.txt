## Using QuPath to generate the WSI images and cellular features

We use the QuPath(0.2.0-m8) [Link](https://qupath.github.io/) to generate the WSI images and cellular features for training and validation.

The capture of working space is shown below:

To run the scripts, please open the script editor via `Automate->Show script editor` and load the script for running.

If you want to extract the WSI images and cellular features, please follow the steps below:

### Extract the WSI Images

For extracting the images, use QuPath script `QuPath_Script\ImagesExport.groovy`.

**Modified Line(please fill the path for saving the extracted images)**:

Line 7: `path="images/" // Please Change the Path`  **(Path for saving the extracted images)**


**Script outputs**:

* **(WSI Images).png**: *.png* file which are the extracted WSI images.

### Extract the cellular features

For extracting the cellular feature, use QuPath script`QuPath_Script\CellularFeaturesExtractionforWholeSlide.groovy`.

**Modified Line(please fill the path for saving the extracted features)**:

Line 92: `save_path = "Feature/"  //CHANGE sve path here` **(Path for saving the extracted features)**

**Script outputs**:

* **(WSI cellular features).txt**: *.txt* file which contains the extracted cellular features for WSI images.
