## Generation of downsampled WSI and its tiled image data for training and validation

After using QuPath to generate the cellular features, if you want to generate the tile data for the GastrolFlow training and validation, please follow the steps below:

**Step 1**: run `QuPath_Script\stage_2.py`

**Modified Line(please fill the path for the path of cellular features of slides)**:

Line 9: `feat_path = "./2022Gastrointernaldataraw/RAW_TXT-SET_20200520/"` **(Path for the cellular features of slides from QuPath)**

**Modified Line(please fill the path for the path of saving)**:

Line 17: `saving_path="./Training_tile/"` **(Immediate path for saving the tile data)**

**Setting of the range of tile ratio**:

Line 10: `tile_ratio = [500]` **(The extracted tile is 500*500)**

**Step 2**: run `QuPath_Script\tile.py`

**Modified Line(please fill the path for the path of step 1 saving path)**:

Line 9: `tile_path = "./Training_tile/RAW_TXT-SET_20200520/"` **(Fill the immediate path in Step 1)**

**Modified Line(please fill the path for the path of saving)**:

Line 20: `df.to_csv("./RAW_TXT-SET_20200520_tiledata_{}.csv".format(r), index=False)` **(Fill the path for saving the final tile data)**

**Script outputs**:

* **(WSI cellular features)_tiledata.csv**: *.csv* file which contains the extracted 41 features for tile data.
